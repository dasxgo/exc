# Rules of Pyton Constructor

- It stats with the "def keyword", like all other functions in Python
- It is followed by the word "init", wich is prefixed and suffixed with double underscores with a pair of bracketts i.e __init__()
- It takes an argument called self, assigning values to the variables

Self is a reference to the current instance of the class, It is creatred an passed automatically/implicitly to the __init__() when the constructor is called
